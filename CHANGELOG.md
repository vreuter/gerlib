# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added
* `EuclideanDistance.unsafe` method, wrapping a `squants.space.Length` value as a `EuclideanDistance`, 
performing the necessary validation as nonnegative and erroring otherwise.
* `configuration` module, with support for parsing definition of pixel lengths for `scopt` or `pureconfig`.
* Instances of `Show` and `SimpleShow` for `geometry.Distance`, with an implementation which can be guaranteed to roundtrip through `Distance.parse`
* Tests for `PixelDefinition` and `Pixels3D`

### Changed
* Changed the error message for refinement of `squants.space.Length` as a `Distance` value from "Allegedly nonnegative length must actually be nonnegative." to "Allegedly nonnegative length is actually negative."
* Updated `sbt` to version 1.12.13

## [v0.5.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
* Updated Unidata repository URL for `cdm-core` dependency, as the upstream structure changed.

## [v0.5.1] - 2025-09-09

### Added
* `cats.Eq` instance for `imaging.FieldOfViewLike`
* Introduced more basic helper functions for reading from ZARR

## [v0.5.0] - 2025-06-17

### Added
* Introduced a transparent `Distance` type alias for a `squants.space.Length` value refined to be nonnegative
* Introduced `Pixels3D` and `PixelDefinition` types

### Changed
* `iron` is now v3.0.0.
* Removed the `ProximityComparable` trait
* Simplified the distance types considerably, removing the `DistanceThreshold` and its subtypes
* Simplification of the numeric refinement types, relying more directly on reference to the underlying `iron` type names
* More general and typesafe way to define a pixel as a unit of length
* Better definition of distance-related types

## [v0.4.1] - 2025-03-19

### Added
* `getRawValue` member to the `FieldOfView` type, such that client code can access the raw nonnegative integer value, but in a clear and intentional way.

### Changed
* More updates regarding Scala 3.6's revision of syntax for `given` instances and for bounds, per SIP-64.
* Apply `-new-syntax` + `-rewrite` to scalac settings.

## [v0.4.0] - 2025-03-12

### Added
* `.jvmopts` to provide more memory for the environment, mainly related to use of Semantic DB with `scalafix`

### Changed
* Generalise the wrapped raw coordinate value, of distance computations to accommodate points with any raw coordinate type `C` for which there's a `Numeric` instance available, rather than restricting to `C =:= Double`.
* Bump Scala from 3.5.2 to 3.6.4.
* Bump up all project plugins and dependencies to latest versions (as of 2025-03-07).
* Update to Scala 3.6's revision of syntax for `given` instances and for bounds, per SIP-64.
* Back off of a couple of the more aggressive applications of `fewerBraces`, as this was not playing nicely between `scalafmt`, `scalafix`, general compilation, and IDE plugin (Metals). 
This seemed to pertain mainly to replacement of braces by colons and indentation in `Try` blocks (i.e., `scala.util.Try`, not `try...catch`).
* Condensed / centralised implementation of `PiecewiseDistance.between`.

## [v0.3.2] - 2024-12-12

### Added
* `flipBy` (aliased also as `swapBy`) as syntax on `Tuple2[A, A]`, similar to `sortBy` on a sequence-like collection

## [v0.3.1] - 2024-12-04

### Added
* `collections.lookupBySubset`
* Documentation for how to build this library

## [v0.3.0] - 2024-11-21

### Changed
* Scala is now version 3.5.2.
* `sbt` is now version 1.10.5.
* License is now Apache 2.0, due to our use of `iron`.

### Added
* `graph` module for graph-related functionality (using `scala-graph`)
* `remove` method as syntax extension on `AtLeast2[Set, X]`, yielding a `NonEmptySet[X]`
* `IntraCellDelimiter[A]` abstraction for reading and writing a CSV cell which contains a collection of individual elements
* The `AtLeast2[C[*], A]` abstraction for a collection/container `C[A]` which must contain at least two elements
* `fs2.data.csv.CellEncoder[AtLeast2[C[*], A]]` instance derivation for when the element type `A` has a `fs2.data.csv.CellEncoder` instance available, and there's an given `IntraCellDelimiter[A]` available

## [v0.2.0] - 2024-10-22

### Changed
* Scala is now 3.5.1.

### Added
* _Many_ new data types and typeclass instances.

## [v0.1.0] - 2024-07-10

### Added
* Core cell biology domain-specific types like `NuclearDesignation`, in `cell` module
* Core geometric types like `Point3D`, in `geometry` module
* Core imaging domain-specific types like `FieldOfView`, in `imaging` module
* Input-/output-related functionality in `io`
* ROI-related functionality in `roi` module
* Simple typeclass instances for many core types
* Code formatting with `scalafmt`
* `sbt-buildinfo` plugin
* `scalafix` plugin

### Changed
* Project structure switches to modules / subprojects, much like `refined` in terms of folder structure and the `build.sbt`.
* Rather than custom `opaque type`s, start using `iron` to represent refined domains of numeric types.
* Use `cats`-style source file layout for syntax enrichment files and typeclass instances files.

## [v0.0.1] - 2024-06-24
* This is the first release.
